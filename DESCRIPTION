Description: A framework for auditing the fidelity of synthetic microbiome data.
    ASMOT uses Multi-Scale Optimal Transport to quantify realism across 
    marginal distributions, joint sample geometry, and ecological network topology.
    Features include Adaptive Weighting (inverse null variance), High-Order 
    Interaction Scanning, and Classifier-based Turing tests.
Imports:
